        <h3>Hello, love! Here's to our first monthsary! Actually, nagplano 
            jud ko magbuhat ani for you pero to ask you as my girlfriend,
            pero u already did HAHAHA. I made this website for you, and mej
            di siya pang pro levels HAHAH kay dili namo ni focus na programming. 
            Pero anyways, I can't say na it was a rough first month kay wala man
            jud ta naga talk and if magka sturya kay madalian. However, it was
            hard for me kay permi tika ma-miss. I miss your pretty eyes, your cute smile,
            and the way ka mag sige kag stare HAHAHA. Oo beh, pansin na pansin kaayo to nako,
            and permi ko maka "shet ni stare napod siya". Don't take this the wrong way,
            kay ma conscious ko pag mag stare ka. Did you know? Sa early days na wala
            paka naka reach sa ako, like zero communication jud ta, I always wished
            na moabot ka sa ako dreams huhu. I really missed your presence that time, and
            until now pod biskan naga talk tayo sometimes. Kabalo ka, maka sad mag laag sa mga
            place na gilaagan nato cuz I wish na kauban tika at that moment, pero it's fine.
            We still have more days naman, we'll take this as a challenge/test in our
            relationship. Magbagtik rakan tang duha na ma balance ni nato sa ato other 
            priorities in life. Please tell me all the things you wish to know, I want us to be
            honest with each other. I'll do my best to make this distance warmer for us,
            but I hope you'll understand that most of the time school rajud ko. ALSO! 
            Know that I won't choose someone else, cuz I want this permanent connection
            we have. <3
        </h3>
        
        <h3>
            May quote ako that best resembles what I feel towards you "You have a place
            in my heart no one could ever have." I hope you know that, my love. Words 
            can't express how I truly feel, but please, let's make this last. No matter 
            the distance. I love you!
        </h3>
